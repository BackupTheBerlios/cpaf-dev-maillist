</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Default font, as above described for get_font?
</I>
Sure, setting the &quot;Default font&quot; is fine. It hsould probably still be moved into
gui::Widget.

&gt;<i> &gt; void    insert_text(str, position)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Effect:	Inserts str at the given position within the widget
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; void    delete_text(int start, int end)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Effect:	Removes the text between positions start and end
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For a really powerful widget, iterators would be fun - but I guess
</I>&gt;<i> cross-platform puts its limits here. And this can be a function of
</I>&gt;<i> Richtext then.
</I>
Iterators would be great but I didn't include them into this iteration of the
api. We'd need to think about how the iterators would actually work for
extraction of elements efficiently. Insertion is easy; text would just be
inserted at the &quot;insertion point&quot; using the insert_str function. Maybe it would
use a different overload of it, one without the position parameter which inserts
text at the current caret position. After an insertion the caret would move to
the end of the inserted text so that inserting more than once works as expected.
We also need to consider how streams will work with what ever string solution we
end up using.

&gt;<i> &gt; int     get_selection_start()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Effect:	Returns the index of the beginning of the selection
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; int     get_selection_end()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Effect:	Returns the index of the end of the selection. If one character is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; selected and the index of the start of the selection is 1, this function
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; returns 2. If no characters are selection and the start index is 1, this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; function returns 1.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> start and end aren't perfect terms here - &quot;start&quot; could come AFTER
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;end&quot;, the position where the cursor blinks is at &quot;end&quot; - this means a
</I>&gt;<i> visual cursor appearance difference (if present), and where the cursor
</I>&gt;<i> moves with arrow keys (either from the right or left end of the
</I>&gt;<i> selection).
</I>
Your right. How about we add

int	get_insertion_position();
Effect:	Returns the character index of the caret within the control.

int     get_selection_start()
Effect:	Returns the index of the beginning of the selection, which is defined as
the left most selected character.

int     get_selection_end()
Effect:	Returns the index of the end of the selection, which is defined as the
right most selected character.

I haven't put too much thought into those so they may not be useful functions.

&gt;<i> &gt; string  get_selection_text()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Effect: Returns a string containing the text that is selected
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would see that as a convenience function - get_text_from_range alike
</I>&gt;<i> thing with get_selection returnt values would be more low-level than
</I>&gt;<i> that, hence the claim that this is a convenience func.
</I>
That reminds me, I forgot about this:

string  get_text_range(int begin, int end)
Effect: Returns the text in the range [begin, end)

&gt;<i> &gt; void    set_selection_text(str)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Effect:	Replaces the selected text with str. The length of str may be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different than the length of the selection.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Postcondition: str is now selected within the widget.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't really like the Postcondition - it's rarely what one wants imho.
</I>&gt;<i> This could be solved through some kind of emulation aswell, as below
</I>&gt;<i> with delete_selection:
</I>
Your probably right, lets drop that post condition then. If the user code wants
it, they can re-select the string they replaced the old selection with. If we
keep the post condition and the programmer doesn't want the string selected it
creates flickering as the text is selected and then immediately deselected.

&gt;<i> &gt; void    delete_selection()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Effect: Deletes the selected text. This is equivilant to setting the selected
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; text to be an empty string.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Postcondition: The selection length is now 0.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Having an effect of &quot;backspace emulation&quot; would be another possibility
</I>&gt;<i> for this functionality - together with a different method name.
</I>
Different method name like what? To go along with &quot;get_text_range()&quot; we should
also have:

void delete_text_range(int begin, int end)
Effect: Removes the text range [begin, end) from the TextWidget.

Can't believe I didn't include this but we also need:

void replace_text_range(int begin, int end, string str)
Effect: Replaces the range of text [begin, end) with str.

What should happen to the caret after replace_text_range has been called?

&gt;<i> &gt; Class:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; EntryBox
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Inherits From:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TextWidget
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Purpose:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This class represents a simple text entry field. It can only contain one line
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of text (is not multilined). It does not implement any new methods.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Later it should have convenience functions for entry boxes - e.g to
</I>&gt;<i> switch to a password box.
</I>
Woops, that should definately be included.

void set_password_character(character c)
Effect: Sets the password character to use for this EntryBox, and also makes
this EntryBox function as a password input box.

Should we include explicit &quot;password box&quot; enable and disable functions instead
of making set_password_character make the EntryBox a password box forever?

&gt;<i> &gt; Class:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TextBox
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Inherits From:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TextWidget
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Purpose:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This class represents a mutliline EditBox. It does not provide anything more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to see some more functionality here later on - basic
</I>&gt;<i> styling, and such.
</I>
No styling. If we add styling support here, where do we draw the line between
this control and RichTextBox? That would be a very difficult choice. If you want
styling, you use RichTextBox. That keeps the api clean. Look at what happened to
wxTextCtrl because some styling support is included, along with physical
RichTextBox support (on certain platforms) which uses the same exact api.

If anybody notices a particular function that they think would be impossible to
implement cleanly on a given port mention it so we don't design something that
won't work.
