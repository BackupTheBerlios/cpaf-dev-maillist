Message-ID: <1126923164.20327.7.camel@localhost>

Hello.

Posting to the list has been restricted to subscribers only for now due
to the sheer volume of spam.
The developers will have to send as username at users.berlios.de or send me
a mail to leio at dustbite.net with [cpaf] in the subject, requesting
additional e-mail addresses to be added to the allowance list. If you do
that, just send from under that SMTP account or whatnot, so I can see
the exact "from" field.
Others can send from the e-mail address with what they are subscribed
with, or can also request allowance from me for posting for other "from"
fields, as necessary.

Thank you for enduring the spam that has slipped through before.
Hopefully berlios will one day install a competent spam filter.

Mart Raudsepp
