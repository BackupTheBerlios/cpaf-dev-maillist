<PRE>After working on widget deletion code for win32, I came up with a scheme for the
sending of WIDGET_DESTROYED events and actually deleting objects that I feel all
ports should adapt to. Please consider if this scheme is feesable on your port
and wether or not you believe it to be a good idea.

Example:
A Window has a Button as its only child. The Window is closed using its X
button. For simpicity assume that the act of closing the window is the same as
calling Window::destroy(). The following events occur in this order:

Window recieves WIDGET_DESTROYED
Button recieves WIDGET_DESTROYED
Button is deleted
Window is deleted

This meets the following gaurentees for WIDGET_DESTROYED:
While processing WIDGET_DESTROYED, it can be assumed all children still exist,
unless they have been explicitly destroyed prior to recieving WIDGET_DESTROYED.
After processing WIDGET_DESTROYED, it must be assumed that all children have
been destroyed and deleted.

Along with meeting these gaurentees, I believe it is also logical for deletion
to happen in this way. The widget that was sent WIDGET_DESTROYED most recently
should be deconstructed first, as if there is a stack of widgets waiting to be
destroyed and the act of sending WIDGET_DESTROYED pushes that widget onto the
stack. (In fact, win32 uses a stack to accomplish this deletion mechanism.)

Thoughts?
