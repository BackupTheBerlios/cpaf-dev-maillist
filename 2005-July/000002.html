<PRE>Note that all indexes are 0 based and that &quot;selection length&quot; means how many
characters are selected.

Class:
TextWidget

Purpose:
Serves as the common base class for the family of text widgets in cpaf.
Features common to all text widgets (selection ranges, inserting and
deleting text, etc) will go into this base.

Methods:

void    set_font(font)
Effect: Sets the font for the text widget to use. This effects all text
contained within the widget
Note:   This function might be better in gui::Widget instead of here

font    get_font()
Effect: Returns the font currently used by the widget
Note:   This function might be better in gui::Widget instead of here

void    set_text(str)
Effect: Replaces the text in the text widget with str

string  get_text()
Effect: Returns a string containing the text in the widget

void    insert_text(str, position)
Effect:	Inserts str at the given position within the widget

void    delete_text(int start, int end)
Effect:	Removes the text between positions start and end

void    set_selection(start, end)
Effect:	Selects the range of text [start, end). start is included, end is not.
If start == end, the caret will be moved to that position and the length of the
selection is zero.

int     get_selection_start()
Effect:	Returns the index of the beginning of the selection

int     get_selection_end()
Effect:	Returns the index of the end of the selection. If one character is
selected and the index of the start of the selection is 1, this function
returns 2. If no characters are selection and the start index is 1, this
function returns 1.

string  get_selection_text()
Effect: Returns a string containing the text that is selected

void    set_selection_text(str)
Effect:	Replaces the selected text with str. The length of str may be
different than the length of the selection.
Postcondition: str is now selected within the widget.

void    delete_selection()
Effect: Deletes the selected text. This is equivilant to setting the selected
text to be an empty string.
Postcondition: The selection length is now 0.

Class:
EntryBox

Inherits From:
TextWidget

Purpose:
This class represents a simple text entry field. It can only contain one line
of text (is not multilined). It does not implement any new methods.

Class:
TextBox

Inherits From:
TextWidget

Purpose:
This class represents a mutliline EditBox. It does not provide anything more
than this.

Methods:

int     get_line_count()
Effect: Returns the number of lines in the TextBox

string  get_line(index)
Effect: Returns a string containing the text of line index

int     get_character_line_index(index)
Effect: Returns the index of the line containing the character at the given
index

int     get_char_index_at_position(point)
Effect: Returns the index of the character at the given position in client
coordinates.

Class:
RichTextBox

Inherits From:
TextWidget

Purpose:
This is a fully featured text widget.

I don't know all that much about RichText widgets in general yet so I will not
propose a specific api for this control at this time.
