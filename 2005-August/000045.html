Dear Friend,

I got to know about you in my desperate search for a reputable person/persons/company to assist us in a confidential business deal requiring utmost trust and urgency. I am Bar.Femi Williams, an attorney and close confidant of Mrs. Joy Gerang, wife of the late War Lord/first vice president of suden.
She (Mrs. Joy Gerang), as a result of the trust and confidence she has in me has mandated me to search for a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner, who will help receive some funds which she had in cash totaling US$16M (sixteen Million Dollars) and a box containing Gold into a personal/ company or any reliable foreign bank account for safe keeping for a short period of time, since her family bank accounts within and outside the country are been monitored by the authorities.
If you have been listening to CNN, BBC, VOA and international news agencies you would have heard about Dr. John Gerang and his twenty one (21) year rebel led war against the federal government and the final peace deal which saw him into the government as the first vice resident on the 9th day of July 2005 and the his death via a controversial helicopter crash on the, 1st day of August 2005 precisely after three weeks in office.
This money in question (US$16M) and the Box of Gold has however been comfortably moved out of the country beyond the knowledge of any one and it is presently lodged with a private security company here in Ghana which has its branches in all the Continents of the world.
Worthy to note is that the federal government of Sudan lead by Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir in her bid to frustrate the Gerang&#146;s family has placed them under partial house arrest with all their international travelers' documents withdrawn pending when the current face-off between opposition and the present administration, which from all indications is creating fear on the federal government based on the unrest emanating from his controversial death.
She has decided to offer anybody who will be willing to render this tremendous assistance 20% of the total sum while a refund of all your expenses will be made to you as soon as this fund is cleared from the security company.
Note: this transaction involves no risk especially now that you are not going to have any dealings whatsoever with anybody in Sudan rather you are going to deal with me or the security company directly.
I shall let you into the complete picture of this mutual beneficial transaction when I hear from you on the above email address or telephone number with hope you are still going to treat this letter as urgent and confidential.
Best regards,

Bar. Femi Williams

Attorney for the family
